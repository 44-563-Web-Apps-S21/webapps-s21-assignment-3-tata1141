        Stephen Vincent Strange M.D., Ph. D is a powerful sorcerer and Master of the Mystic Arts.
         Originally a brilliant, although arrogant, neurosurgeon, Strange got into a car accident
         which resulted with his hands becoming crippled.

         Doctor Strange uses his ability to create holes in the space-time 
         continuum to bring all the Marvel characters who once disappeared back in the fight 
         against Thanos after Thanos jumps forward in time to attack the Avengers.
          We last see Doctor Strange at Tony Stark's funeral.
