        It has super vision.
         Bees have the ability to see ultraviolet light, meaning they can see colors 
         we cannot even fathom. This helps them find food,
          since many flowers have ultraviolet bull's-eyes highlighting 
          where the pollen and nectar lives.

Not only can bees count to 4 and remember numbers (which is really impressive for any animal),
 they can instinctually solve complex mathematical problems. Namely,
  bees rock the ‘traveling salesman problem’, a practice in determining
   the shortest and most efficient route between multiple points.
    They are the only animal that is able to do this. Even more unbelievable,
     some scientists even claim that bees are unwitting experts in quantum mechanics.
     <ul>
        <li>Bees can control their body temperature</li>
        <li>bees are super intelligent</li>
        <p>As for their brains, they are densely packed with gray matter, which is a sign of evolved intelligence</p>
        <li>Bees can literally change their brain chemistry</li>
    </ul>
